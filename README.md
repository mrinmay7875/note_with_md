## Features

- **Your data stays on your device:** Since we use local storage, all your notes are stored locally on your device. There is no transmission of data over the internet, ensuring complete privacy.
- **No external access:** As your data is not sent to any external servers, there is no risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Only you have access to your notes.


## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript with Vite
- Routing: Tanstack Router for Routing
- State management: Redux with Redux tool kit
